# flask_blog

Blog made with Flask (for learning purposes). Most of the code was taken from the book [Learning Flask Framework](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-flask-framework), by Charles Leifer and Matt Copperwaite (Nov'2015). 

This code is written in Python 3.5 (as opposed to Python 2.7 that the book uses). A few bugs that were found in the book's code were fixed. Also, some additional improvements were implemented.
